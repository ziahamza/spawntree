# spawntree-daemon

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#37](https://github.com/ziahamza/spawntree/pull/37) [`c94e6f9`](https://github.com/ziahamza/spawntree/commit/c94e6f974509025e6b9281563283b178a3d94863) Thanks [@ziahamza](https://github.com/ziahamza)! - Centralized storage config sync via `--host` / `--host-key`.

  **Daemon**: new CLI flags `--host <url>` and `--host-key <dh_…>` bind a daemon
  to a `spawntree-host` server. The pair is persisted to `~/.spawntree/host.json`
  (0600) so subsequent boots don't need the args. On boot, the daemon pulls its
  `StorageConfig` from `GET /api/daemons/me/config` and reconciles in-place via
  `StorageManager.applyConfig` — primary swaps with data migration, replicators
  diff by `rid`. Boot is non-blocking: 5-min steady-state poll, exponential
  backoff (5s → 30s → 2m → 10m) on failure, `awaiting_config` state on host 404.
  Status snapshot exposed via `GET /api/v1/storage`.

  **Host**: new `daemons` table + endpoints. `POST /api/daemons` mints a `dh_…`
  bearer credential (only revealed once); `GET /api/daemons` lists fingerprints;
  `GET|PUT /api/daemons/<key>/config` lets operators push the config; `DELETE`
  revokes; `GET /api/daemons/me/config` is the daemon's auth-gated read with
  `Authorization: Bearer <key>`. The bearer token is identity + auth in one
  shot — no separate daemon ID.

  See `docs/host-config.md` for the full operator walkthrough.

### Patch Changes

- [#37](https://github.com/ziahamza/spawntree/pull/37) [`c94e6f9`](https://github.com/ziahamza/spawntree/commit/c94e6f974509025e6b9281563283b178a3d94863) Thanks [@ziahamza](https://github.com/ziahamza)! - Backfill git metadata from `working_directory` in the discovery loop, plus
  re-export `detectGitMetadata` from `spawntree-core` for downstream daemons.

  **Why**: some sessions reach `runDiscoveryPass` with NULL git metadata —
  most commonly older Codex sessions whose `thread.gitInfo` wasn't captured
  at session creation time. Without a `gitBranch` value those rows can't be
  linked to a PR in the consuming UI, even though the session is clearly
  tied to a particular branch on disk.

  **Daemon**: when `discoverSessions` returns a row with any of `gitBranch /
gitHeadCommit / gitRemoteUrl` null, `SessionManager.runDiscoveryPass` now
  runs `git rev-parse` against the session's `workingDirectory` and merges
  in whatever's missing. Adapter-reported values always win; we only fill
  nulls. A per-cwd cache prevents the daemon from re-spawning git on every
  30-second discovery tick. Sessions whose `workingDirectory` no longer
  exists (deleted worktree) skip the spawn entirely — the existing nulls
  stay null, which is correct.

  **Core**: re-exports `detectGitMetadata` and `GitMetadata` from
  `spawntree-core`'s public entry point so daemons (and other downstream
  consumers) can use the same git detection helper without depending on
  internal `lib/git.ts` paths. The helper itself was added to core by [#31](https://github.com/ziahamza/spawntree/issues/31).

- [#37](https://github.com/ziahamza/spawntree/pull/37) [`c94e6f9`](https://github.com/ziahamza/spawntree/commit/c94e6f974509025e6b9281563283b178a3d94863) Thanks [@ziahamza](https://github.com/ziahamza)! - Close two SQL classifier bypasses on `/api/v1/catalog/query-readonly` that
  became remotely exploitable when the loopback gate was lifted from that
  route in [#33](https://github.com/ziahamza/spawntree/issues/33).

  1. **Writable CTE bypass**: `WITH d AS (SELECT 1) INSERT INTO repos(...) VALUES(...)`
     is a single statement starting with `WITH` but performing a write — the
     classifier accepted it. Now: when first keyword is `WITH`, scan the body
     for `INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/REPLACE/MERGE/UPSERT` as whole words outside
     strings + comments. Reject with `READONLY_QUERY_REJECTED`. Pure-read CTEs
     continue to pass.

  2. **PRAGMA classifier — switched from denylist to fail-closed allow-list**.
     The previous deny-list let writes slip through for any pragma not
     explicitly listed (e.g. `PRAGMA cache_size = 0`). A first-pass fix
     universally rejected the `=` form, but Devin's follow-on review caught
     that for stateful pragmas the function-call form is also a write —
     `PRAGMA cache_size(0)` is equivalent to `PRAGMA cache_size = 0` and
     was still reachable. The shipped fix is a strict allow-list:

     - `ALLOWED_PRAGMAS: Map<name, "bare" | "function" | "both">` enumerates
       every read-safe pragma along with the form(s) it's allowed in.
     - Pragmas not on the map → rejected.
     - `=` form → always rejected (no map entry can override).
     - `(arg)` form → only allowed for `"function"` / `"both"` entries
       (introspection pragmas like `table_info`, `index_list`, etc.).
     - bare form → only allowed for `"bare"` / `"both"` entries.

     Future SQLite pragmas are blocked by default until reviewed and added
     to the allow-list. No more "we missed one in the deny list" follow-ups.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#14](https://github.com/ziahamza/spawntree/pull/14) [`fb288c0`](https://github.com/ziahamza/spawntree/commit/fb288c0ebc077407d64efbce923b4cf42dc9ccb5) Thanks [@ziahamza](https://github.com/ziahamza)! - Add agent session API — drive Claude Code and Codex through the daemon as
  first-class sessions.

  - Normalized `ACPAdapter` layer in `spawntree-core` (Claude Code via native ACP,
    Codex via JSON-RPC app-server facade). Third-party providers register via
    `SessionManager.registerAdapter`.
  - New HTTP API: `/api/v1/sessions` (list, create, detail, delete, send message,
    interrupt, per-session SSE events). Session events also mirror onto the main
    `/api/v1/events` stream as `type: "session_event"`.
  - Typed SDK methods on `ApiClient`: `listSessions`, `createSession`,
    `getSession`, `deleteSession`, `sendSessionMessage`, `interruptSession`,
    `streamSessionEvents`.
  - Typed errors with HTTP status translations: `SessionBusyError` → 409,
    `SessionDeleteUnsupportedError` → 501, `UnknownProviderError` /
    `ProviderCapabilityError` → 400.
  - Fixes: permission policy fails closed on reject\_\*, concurrent sendMessage
    rejected with 409, deleteSession actually works (or returns 501), findSession
    cached to avoid spawning unrelated adapter subprocesses, totalTurns normalized
    across providers, per-session event history replay filtered by sessionId.
  - Devin review fixes: JSON-RPC transport now emits `jsonrpc: "2.0"` on every
    request and notification (spec-required; Codex is permissive today but strict
    servers would reject). `SessionManager.createSession` now subscribes to
    adapter events BEFORE calling `adapter.createSession` so events emitted during
    startup aren't dropped. `listSessions` also subscribes to each adapter it
    successfully queries. `decodeBody` moved inside try/catch so invalid POST
    bodies map to HTTP 400. `registerAdapter` unsubscribes + shuts down the old
    instance when replacing. Adapter `start()` uses a `startPromise` mutex so
    concurrent callers don't race the `initialize()` handshake. Host-server
    escapes HTML on its landing page and preserves full query strings on
    proxied URLs.
  - New installable package `spawntree-host-server` (at `packages/host-server/`)
    exposes a `bin` so teams can `npm i -g` or `npx spawntree-host-server` to
    run the federation server without copying source.

- [#25](https://github.com/ziahamza/spawntree/pull/25) [`72a43f6`](https://github.com/ziahamza/spawntree/commit/72a43f6b110ae2f98e541a42f4434afc2cddeffc) Thanks [@ziahamza](https://github.com/ziahamza)! - Pluggable storage providers, typed catalog via Drizzle, and ACP session persistence.

  ### Storage providers (`spawntree-core/storage`, `spawntree-daemon/storage`)

  - `PrimaryStorageProvider` + `ReplicatorProvider` contracts, registry, and three
    built-in providers: `local` (plain libSQL file), `turso-embedded` (libSQL
    embedded replica with `syncUrl`), `s3-snapshot` (VACUUM INTO + atomic
    CopyObject upload).
  - `StorageManager` orchestrates the active primary + replicators, serializes
    mutations via an internal lock, and supports hot-swapping the primary with
    transactional data migration (rollback on failure keeps the old primary
    active).
  - HTTP admin surface at `/api/v1/storage/*` with probe endpoints, loopback
    origin gating (opt out with `SPAWNTREE_STORAGE_TRUST_REMOTE=1`), and
    `0600` file perms on `~/.spawntree/storage.json`.

  ### Typed catalog via Drizzle (`spawntree-core/db`)

  - Drizzle schema for all 8 catalog tables (`repos`, `clones`, `worktrees`,
    `watched_paths`, `registered_repos`, `sessions`, `session_turns`,
    `session_tool_calls`) is the single source of truth for shape, indexes, and
    foreign keys. Row types exported via `$inferSelect` / `$inferInsert`.
  - `drizzle-kit` wired up for future schema changes; baseline migration checked
    in at `packages/core/src/db/migrations/`.
  - External consumers get two client surfaces:
    - `createCatalogClient({ url })` / `createCatalogClientAsync({ url })` for
      direct libSQL access (local file or Turso replica).
    - `createCatalogHttpDb({ url })` / `catalogHttpProxy({ url })` for daemon-side
      HTTP access, backed by Drizzle's `sqlite-proxy` driver. Consumers write
      standard `db.select()` / `db.query.*` / joins against a shared schema —
      no read endpoints to re-implement.
  - Daemon-side `CatalogDatabase` wrapper replaced with direct Drizzle queries.
    `better-sqlite3` removed from daemon deps.
  - `POST /api/v1/catalog/query` + `POST /api/v1/catalog/batch` implement the
    server side of the sqlite-proxy protocol. Loopback-gated by default.

  ### ACP session persistence

  - `SessionManager` now takes a `StorageManager` and mirrors every ACP adapter
    event into the catalog DB so sessions survive daemon restart, ride along
    with the s3-snapshot replicator, and are queryable by external Drizzle
    clients.
  - Per-session write queue serializes events so `turn_completed` can't race
    `turn_started`. `flushPersist()` exposed for tests and shutdown.
